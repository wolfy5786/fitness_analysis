# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Fitness Data Analysis & Activity Classification

This project leverages a large-scale physiological monitoring dataset to analyze user activity patterns, handle missing data, and build a predictive model to classify physical activity types. It showcases the power of exploratory analysis and dimensionality reduction in a real-world health and fitness dataset.

## üîç Key Features

- **Dataset**: PM Data dataset  
  - 2+ million measurements  
  - 2,440 recorded activity sessions  
  - Data collected from 16 individuals over **5 months**
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Uncovered user-specific activity patterns and trends across time
  - Analyzed sensor data including heart rate, acceleration, temperature, and movement metrics

- **Missing Data Handling**:
  - Applied **Linear Regression Imputation** to fill **12% missing values** in numerical features
